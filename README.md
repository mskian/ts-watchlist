# Movie & Series Watchlist

Movie & Series Watchlist web app | Manage Your Watchlist with Ease  

**Note**  

I primarily built this tool for personal use, and I mostly run it on my home server or localhost. I use Tasker to trigger the URL monitor. This tool is not recommended for production use, as it lacks additional security layers such as header authentication, API keys, or token methods to prevent unauthorized access. However, you are welcome to fork the project and make any changes as needed.
